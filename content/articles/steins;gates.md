Steins;Gate is an amine series that aired from April 6, 2011, until September 14, 2011. It is a science fiction, psychological thriller story that follows Okabe Rintaro as the main character, Kurisu Makise and Mayuri Shiina as round characters, and a handful of other flat characters.

The story takes place in 2010. When Okabe Rintaro aka Okarin creates a device that allows people to send messages to the past and change the present and the future, he is in danger of an organization that wants the device. Okarin has to avoid being caught and at the same time, prevent the death of one of his friends, Mayuri Shiina.

Despite Okarin being desperate and in need of help throughout most of the series, and the fact that many characters die and get revived again, the story manages to keep the atmosphere light and when it is required, bring out the dark for a more dramatic effect.

The unbelievable character development, along with the story's great structure, and the fact that the story can change tact very quickly and professionally, makes this an enjoyable and emotional series to watch.
