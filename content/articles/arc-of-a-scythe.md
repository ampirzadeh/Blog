Arc of a scythe, what a series, what a series indeed. Perhaps the best books I have ever read.

The series which consists of 3 books, was written by Neal Shusterman (58 years old) and published by Simon & Schuster in 2016.
All the books are set in a future (about 350 years from now) where death by natural causes such as disease and old age has been conquered and humans can set back their age or "turn a corner" to a certain age that they wish for.

Due to humans being basically immortal, the problem of not enough resources and overpopulation arises and the "scythedom" is born.

Scythes, being named scythes because they are only tools for society, are chosen people who choose other people for gleaning (killing them).

The series revolves around Citra Terranova and Rowan Damisch and some exceptionally well-developed side characters. These two 16-year-olds must go through scythe apprenticeship under the teachings of "Honorable Scythe Faraday" who was a character that I love.

The series has a very deep meaning beneath its surface about the nature of humanity, friendship, compassion, love, and most importantly, life and death.

The main antagonist in the series is not-quite-so-honorable Scythe Goddard.

In case you're familiar with the names Goddard and Faraday, I must say that these two people along with many of the other characters in the books are named after their chosen historian patriots. Changing their names when they're chosen as scythes to show the end of their previous life.

I liked Shusterman's choice to name the characters after historian figures very much because it was quite fun to compare the characters' descriptions in the books with the historian figure himself, and commonly there were some similarities that made me burst out laughing.

It was apparent that Neil Shusterman does not write a book without doing the research first and spends a lot of time on each character, hence the story being so emotional and overwhelming at points.

In general, the series had everything a good series should have: Character development, villain development, a grey villain rather than a black one, enjoyable story-telling, interesting concepts, surprising yet pleasant turn of events, relatable main characters that are not perfect, complications and simplicity and points and many more qualities that I can't write but you can count on Scythe, Thunderhead, and The Toll, to have them.

To cap it all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into science fiction, history, people, the meaning of life and death, stories that take place in the future, stories that take place in the past, and in general anyone who can read.

Where are you, my dear Marie? My existence has been all about silencing life,
but until now I have not dared to entertain that wholly mortal-age question of
what lies beyond the silence. Such elaborate ideas those mortals had! Heaven
and hell—nirvana and Valhalla, reincarnations, hauntings, and so many
underworlds, one would think the grave was a corridor with a million doors.
Mortals were the children of extremes. Either death was sublime, or it was
unthinkable—such a mélange of hope and terror, no wonder so many mortals
were driven mad.

We post-mortals lack such imagination. The living do not ponder death
anymore. Or at least not until a scythe pays a visit. But once the scythe’s
business is done, mourning is brief, and thoughts of what it means to “not be”
disappear, vanquished by nanites that disrupt dark, unproductive thinking. As
post-mortals of perpetually sound mind, we are not allowed to dwell on that
which we cannot change.
But my nanites are dialed low, and therefore I do dwell. And I find myself
asking again and again, where are you, my dear Marie?
